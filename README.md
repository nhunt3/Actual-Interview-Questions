Actual-Interview-Questions
==========================
Consider a "word" as any sequence of letters A-Z (not limited to just "dictionary words").  For any word
with at least two different letters, there are other words composed of the same letters but in a different
order (for instance, stationarily/antiroyalist, which happen to both be dictionary words; for our purposes
"aaiilnorstty" is also a "word" composed of the same letters as these two). 
We can then assign a number to every word, based on where it falls in an alphabetically sorted list of all
words made up of the same set of letters.  One way to do this would be to generate the entire list of
words and find the desired one, but this would be slow if the word is long. 
Write a program which takes a word as a command line argument and prints to standard output its
number.  Do not use the method above of generating the entire list.  Your program should be able to
accept any word 25 letters or less in length (possibly with some letters repeated), and should use no
more than 1 GB of memory and take no more than 500 milliseconds to run.

Sample words, with their rank:

ABAB = 2

AAAB = 1

BAAA = 4

QUESTION = 24572

BOOKKEEPER = 10743

Your program will be judged on how fast it runs and how clearly the code is written. We will be
running your program as well as reading the source code, so anything you can do to make this
process easier would be appreciated.
